## Design hotel reservation bot

We use the experience of reserving a Hotel room on hilton.com to begin with.
### The following information are collected from a user.
1. Place
2. Date of travel
3. Minimum and maximum budget per night
4. Room type
5. Room amenities
6. Distance from airport
7. Distance from city center

### Hotel search
- Once all the information are collected, the bot will do a search on all available hotels that meet the requirements.
- A user can change information that has been previously captured 

In order to simulate realistic search,
- We collect 32 Hilton hotels in Portland Oregon and SouthWest Washington areas. Example:
```json
{
    "id": "368dedd8-8bd8-4a02-bffa-a46a66e58337",
    "_ts": 1762557263,
    "_rid": "AQAAAAEAAAAAAAAZpgmX3DAAD6E=",
    "name": "The Porter Portland, Curio Collection by Hilton",
    "_etag": "5aa8601a-a7e8-4e57-94fa-304729c5a0f3",
    "_self": "dbs/picoflow/colls/hotels/docs/368dedd8-8bd8-4a02-bffa-a46a66e58337/",
    "level": 120,
    "nearby": {
        "airport": 12.4,
        "cityCenter": 0.5
    },
    "address": "1355 SW 2nd Ave. Portland, Oregon 97201 USA",
    "roomType": [
        "one bed",
        "two beds",
        "suite"
    ],
    "amenities": {
        "boutique": true,
        "freeWiFi": true,
        "digitalKey": true,
        "indoorPool": true,
        "nonSmoking": true,
        "petFriendly": true,
        "roomService": true,
        "fitnessCenter": true,
        "businessCenter": true,
        "onSiteRestaurant": true
    }
}
```
- The hotel attributes were obtained from hilton.com website.
- We devise a simulated pricing engine to account for room types, amenities, original base price, weekdays vs weekends vs Holidays travels, distance from airport and distance from city center.

### Hotel comparison
- once a list of Hotels are presented to a user, allow a user to compare pricing, amenities and other attributes across the date range.
- allow a user to exit the comparison loop and book a hotel.
