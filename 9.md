## cookie-cutting approach
Picoflow provides perhaps the simplest way to create very complex bot-chat flows that require complex context engineering and user interaction. 

Recall:
>[!Info]
>1. Create a flow and its steps , set the step attributes such as memory, LLM usage.
>2. Implement each step, decides what tools to provide and how to be handled.
>3. Within tool handler, write your logic and interact with backend 
>4. Decide which next step to transition to, what message to surface to a user, what data to pass to next step.
>5. Deploy your `one endpoint` NodeJS docker container for consumption.


>[!IMPORTANT]
>1. We have not guard-railing the LLM so that it cannot be coerced by a user's response.
>2. The topic of debugging a chatbot especially in production is critical. Picoflow provides facilities to ease debugging.
>3. Picoflow also provides an ability to re-play a conservation sometimes only surfaces in production. 
>4. Picoflow can also incorporate other non-LLM steps, mimicking a traditional business flow step. 
>4. All these will be advanced features to be published and discussed in the future.
