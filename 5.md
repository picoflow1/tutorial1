We will design three complex steps to do the entire flow.
1. Explore Step
2. Present Step
3. Compare Step

## Hotel Flow Code

We will create a  `HotelFlow` and add these three steps.
It is super easy and clean to configure the steps as follow:

Full flow code:
```javascript
export class HotelFlow extends Flow {
  public constructor() {
    super(HotelFlow);
  }

  protected defineSteps(): Step[] {
    return [
      new ExploreStep(this, true).setTemperature(0.5),
      new PresentStep(this, false),
      new CompareStep(this, false),
      new EndStep(this).useMemory('end'),
    ];
  }
}
```

## What are these steps?
1. ExploreStep: will collect all the information from a user adequate enough to book the hotel. This is no different than from hilton.com you will enter these information.
2. PresentStep: will search for a suitable hotel and present to a user.
3. CompareStep: will allow a user to compare chosen hotels on price, amenities and a few attributes.

>[!Tip]
>Granularity of step design:
>
>The complexity of a single step can be controlled by a developer. We can create many smaller steps to collect various piece of information instead of one big `ExploreStep`.
>Breaking into smaller steps will increase reliability of the LLM flow because each step is simpler and reduce hallucination possibility.
>However, a user cannot go back to correct prior step information entered without more sophisticated routing mechanism in place.
>
> We chose lumping collection of all information in a single step to allow flexibility of navigation with a slightly increase risk of LLM huluccination, which can be mitigated with a variety of other techniques. 

## Wrapping up
Next, let's five in the implementation of each step.
